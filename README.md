# About-CountryðŸŒŽ
 Learning application. Where you can get to know about general information of eah country.

 ### How it's made
 - I used rest countries API for accessing the data.
 - This api is avaialble at public-api repo on github
 - After receiving the data , I simply destructured that info using rest operation.
 - Well I made a input box where user can input a Country name.
 - Aftere receiving that name I searched in that destructured array.
 - If it is present then a nice card will be shown, which contains general data about that country.

 ## What I leraned 
 - how JS works behind these api calls.
 - That is how JS engine in chrome manages microtask queue, and callback queue.
 - I also learnt functionality and uasage Promises as well as async and await.
 
 
 This was a great project to know all about async functionalty works and priority of execution two queues of javascript.ðŸ–‡âŒ›
